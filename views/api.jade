				p.
					What if with a little JavaScript magic your apps could pull someone's lights in the mix? Our API gives you complete control over lights that will feel very familiar to anyone who uses jQuery. Spark offers simple API calls, for example, to check how bright a light is, fade it up or down over a given duration, and schedule these actions to be triggered later.

					We're working on native libraries for languages like Ruby, Python, Java, and Objective-C to make your life even easier. Make great native and web apps that can reach into the real world and tap your users on the shoulder. Well, almost.
