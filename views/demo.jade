				p I'm Spark. I connect your lights to the internet. Why? Well, a bunch of reasons. I let you control your lights from any smartphone, tablet, or computer. I make any light fixture dimmable, so you can have mood lighting. But most amazingly - most awesomely - I let apps interact with your lights. And that means by downloading an app on your phone, you can have a "sunrise" alarm clock that turns on your lights slowly to help you wake up in the morning, or a vacation app that turns on your lights randomly while you're away so it looks like someone's home, or a million other things. Pretty cool, huh?

				p I'm here for you, friends. I've got a pretty cool, unbelieveably easy-to-use API so you can make great apps for Spark. It looks like this:
				code curl -X POST http://sprk.io/v1/devices/Elroy/turnOn
				p That's an API call to turn on a light named "Elroy". Want to see more? Check out our API docs to learn more about the first RESTful API for your lights.
